Here are a couple of things to be aware of as you begin to use packrat.

### Package types

Packrat currently only works with three types of packages: 

1. Packages installed from a CRAN repository (or a CRAN-like repository such as
   BioConductor)
2. Packages installed by `devtools::install_github`, version 1.4 or later.
3. Local source packages (via the `source.packages` parameter)

If you depend on a package that doesn't fall into any of these types, you'll
need to coerce it into one of these types. The easiest way to do this is to put
the package's source into a `.tar.gz` file, and use the `source.packages`
parameter. Note that if you use this mechanism, you will need to update the
version of the package every time you make a change to the source code; Packrat
relies on version numbers for local source packages to know when they've been
updated.

### Building packages

Packrat prefers to install binary versions of packages from CRAN-like
repositories when available. However, many packages don't have binaries, and
even those that do now may not have them in the near future (CRAN does not
archive binaries, only sources). 

Packrat stores the sources for each package locally, so that your project never
depends on having platform binaries available from a mirror.

However, this means it is almost certain that you'll need to be able to build
source packages locally in order to use Packrat. See [Package Development
Prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) to learn
more about the tools to install for your operating system. It's recommended
that you and your collaborators prepare your machines for package development
before using Packrat.
