\description{
Remove unused packages from the given library.
}
\details{
Detects and removes orphaned packages. Orphaned packages are those that meet
the following criteria:
\itemize{
  \item Installed in the library
  \item Not directly used by any \R code in the project
  \item Not a dependency of any non-orphaned package
}
If \code{clean} wants to remove a package but your project actually needs the
package, add a statement such as \code{\link{require}(package-name)} to any .R
file in your project's directory.
