# packrat

Packrat is a dependency management system for R.

Use packrat to make your R projects more:

* **Isolated:** Installing a new or updated package for one project won't affect your other projects, and vice versa. That's because packrat gives each project its own private package library.
* **Portable:** Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.
* **Reproducible:** Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions get installed in the future.

## Commands

#### `bootstrap(projectDir = ".")`

> Initializes a regular R project directory as a packrat project. This creates the supporting files and directories listed below in "Anatomy of a packrat project". **You must restart your R session after running `bootstrap()` in order to use packrat.**

#### `diff(projectDir = ".", scan.sources = TRUE)`

> Shows the differences between the project's packrat dependencies and private package library.

> These differences are created when you use the normal R package management commands like `install.packages()`, `update.packages()`, and `remove.packages()`. To reconcile these differences with packrat, you can use `add()` and `remove()`.

> Differences can also arise if one of your collaborators adds or removes packages from the packrat dependencies. In this case, you simply need to tell packrat to update your private package library using `update()`.

#### `update(projectDir = ".", keep = TRUE)`

> Update the project's private package library with packrat.

> You'll need to call this after copying a project onto a new machine, or if you're using version control (see section below) and someone else added a package that you don't have installed yet. **TODO: Should we check the package library's contents vs. packrat.lock at startup? If in interactive mode we could warn, and in non-interactive mode we could warn or error out?**

> **TODO: Keep**

#### `add(packages = NULL)`

> **TODO**
 
#### `remove(packages = NULL)`

> **TODO**

#### `nuke(remove.description = FALSE, remove.lockfile = TRUE)`

> **TODO**

## Anatomy of a packrat project

A packrat project contains a few extra files and directories. The `bootstrap()` function creates these files for you, if they don't already exist.

* `library/`: Private package library for this project.
* `DESCRIPTION`: Lists the packages that the project directly depends on. During bootstrap, Packrat scans your R code for `library` and `require` calls and populates this file automatically, but you can also edit this file by hand.
* `packrat.lock`: Lists the precise package versions that were used to satisfy the dependencies, including dependencies of dependencies. (This file should never be edited by hand!)
* `packrat.sources/`: Source packages of all the dependencies that packrat has been made aware of.
* `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron`: Directs R to use the private package library (when it is started from the project directory).

## Using packrat with version control

Packrat is designed to work hand in hand with Git, Subversion, or any other version control system. Be sure to check in the `.Rprofile`, `.Renviron`, `DESCRIPTION`, and `packrat.lock` files, as well as everything under `packrat.sources/`. You can tell your VCS to ignore `library` (or feel free to check it in if you don't mind taking up some extra space in your repository).
