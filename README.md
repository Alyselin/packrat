# packrat

Packrat is a dependency management system for R.

Use packrat to make your R projects more:

* **Isolated:** Installing a new or updated package for one project won't break your other projects, and vice versa. That's because packrat gives each project its own private package library.
* **Portable:** Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.
* **Reproducible:** Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

See the [project page](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) for more information.
