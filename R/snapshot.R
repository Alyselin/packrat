#' Capture and store the packages and versions in use
#' 
#' Finds the packages in use by the R code in the application, and stores a list
#' of those packages, their sources, and their current versions in packrat.
#' @param appDir Directory containing application. Defaults to current working 
#'   directory.
#' @param available A database of available packages, as returned by 
#'   \code{\link{available.packages}}. It is only necessary to supply this 
#'   parameter if the state being snapshotted includes packages not installed 
#'   locally, which is rare.
#' @param lib.loc The library to snapshot. Defaults to the private library 
#'   associated with the given directory.
#' @param sourcePackagePaths A character vector of directories containing R 
#'   package sources. It is only necessary to supply this parameter when using a
#'   package for which sources exist on neither CRAN or Github.
#' @param orphan.check \code{TRUE} to check for orphaned packages; \code{FALSE} 
#'   to skip the check. Packrat only considers packages used by your code and 
#'   packages which are dependencies of packages used by your code. Any other 
#'   package in the private library is considered an orphan.  If the packages
#'   are truly orphans, they can be removed with \code{\link{clean}}; if they
#'   are not, you can make packrat aware that your project needs them by adding
#'   a \code{require} statement to any R file (see
#'   \code{\link{appDependencies}}).
#' @param ignore.stale Stale packages are packages that are different from the 
#'   last snapshot, but were installed by packrat. Typically, packages become
#'   stale when a new snapshot is available, but you haven't applied it yet with
#'   \code{\link{restore}}. By default, packrat will prevent you from taking a 
#'   snapshot when you have stale packages to prevent you from losing changes
#'   from the unapplied snapshot. If your intent is to overwrite the last
#'   snapshot without applying it, use \code{ignore.stale = TRUE} to skip this
#'   check.
#' @param dry.run Computes the changes to your packrat state that would be made 
#'   if a snapshot were performed, and prints them to the console.
#' @param prompt \code{TRUE} to prompt before performing snapshotting package 
#'   changes that might be unintended; \code{FALSE} to perform these operations 
#'   without confirmation. Potentially unintended changes include snapshotting 
#'   packages at an older version than the last snapshot, or missing despite 
#'   being present in the last snapshot.
#'   
#' @note \code{snapshot} modifies the project's \code{packrat.lock} file, and
#' the sources stored in the project's \code{packrat.sources} directory. If you
#' are working with a version control system, your collaborators can sync the
#' changes to these files and then use \code{\link{restore}} to apply your
#' snapshot.
#' @seealso
#' \code{\link{restore}} to apply a snapshot. 
#' \code{\link{status}} to view the differences between the most recent snapshot
#' and the library.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' # Take a snapshot of the current project
#' snapshot()
#' 
#' # See what changes would be included in a snapshot
#' snapshot(dry.run = TRUE)
#' 
#' # Take a snapshot of a project that includes a custom package
#' snapshot(sourcePackagePaths = "~/R/MyCustomPackage")
#' }
